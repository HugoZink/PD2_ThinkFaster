# Think Faster
A mod for PAYDAY 2 which makes enemies more responsive by increasing the maximum task throughput. This also optimizes their thinking a little in order to counteract performance issues.

# Overview
By default, the game has a task limit of 60 per second. This means that as more cops enter the map, the enemies get dumber and less responsive. This mod strongly raises the task cap,
while also reducing the amount of "useless" tasks that are generated by the game.

# Installation
Grab the latest zip file release from the Releases section, and install it to PAYDAY 2/mods. BLT Hook is required.
